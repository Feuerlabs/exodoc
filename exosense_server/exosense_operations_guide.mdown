## Exosense Server Operation

The Exosense Server runs as a single Linux process (the Erlang VM).



### Installing an Exosense Server

In the following, we will refer to the top directory where the Exosense server
is installed as $EXODM_DIR (as in EXOsense Device Management, the name 'exodm'
will appear in several places in the file structure, and is also the default
node name for the Erlang VM instance).

Declare the environment variable `EXODM_DIR` in a suitable startup file,
e.g. `.bashrc` or `.login`.

Start by unpacking the tar file containing the Exosense server system.

    $ cd $EXODM_DIR
    $ tar xf exosense_server-X.Y.Z.tgz

In the current example, the Exosense server version is 0.2.24. To make this
the current version, we issue a control command:

    $ rel/lib/exodm_0.2.24/ctl install

This will set up links and creates necessary files, among other things copying the `ctl` script to the `$EXODM_ROOT` directory. This script can be used to start, stop, and upgrade the node, as well as attach to a running node.

### Starting the server

To start a node running in the background - the normal way of starting the node:

    $ ./ctl start

If you want to view the activity at startup, and work interactively in the Erlang shell:

    $ ./ctl console

### Attaching to the Exosense server console

    $ ./ctl attach
    $ ...

Attaching to the console means jumping into the Erlang shell. Using the shell, you can inspect the system, interactively call various functions and modify logging parameters.

### Stopping the Exosense Server

    $ ./ctl stop

If the server is up and running, the command will return 'ok'. If it isn't
running, the command will report that it cannot reach the node.

### Upgrading the Exosense Server

In the current version, the server is upgraded by stopping, possibly transforming the database, and restarting the node. Before stopping the node, you should unpack the latest release. The upgrade command will determine the currently installed version and start a node that performs any necessary conversions, and terminates when done.

    $ ./ctl stop
    $ rel/lib/exodm_0.2.25/ctl upgrade
    $ ./ctl start

If the above went well, you should be able to attach to the console.

### Backing up data hosted by the Exosense Server

The server uses append-only data structures on disk, so performing a normal backup on the `$EXODM_ROOT` directory will be suffifient to back up the system.

### Restoring Exosense Server backup data

Use normal restore procedures for the `$EXODM_ROOT` directory and start the system normally.

### Installing a Plugin

Plugins are loaded dynamically from the rel/plugins/ directory. Any plugins
residing in that directory will be automatically loaded at startup, but can
also be loaded/upgraded in service.

Plugins are expected to follow the Erlang/OTP packaging concept, e.g.:

    rel/plugins/
    ......my_plugin-1.0/
    ............ebin/
    ..................my_plugin.app
    ..................*.beam

As an example, here is a plugin that has been started automatically by
the system

    (exodm_n1@uwair.local)2> [A ||Â A <- application:which_applications(),
                                   element(1,A) == exodm_ck3].
    [{exodm_ck3,"Exosense DM-specific functions for Getaround CK3",
      "1.3.2"}]

If we want to upgrade the plugin to, say, version 1.3.4, we unpack that
version under rel/plugins/

    uwair:exodm uwiger$ ls -1 rel/plugins
    exodm_ck3-1.3.2
    exodm_ck3-1.3.4

In the exodm Erlang shell, we can now reload (note: all plugins that need
upgrading will be upgraded):

    (exodm_n1@uwair.local)3> exodm:reload().
    [exodm_ck3 vsn "1.3.4"] code:add_patha(/.../rel/plugins/exodm_ck3-1.3.4/ebin)
    [exodm_ck3 vsn "1.3.4"] soft upgrade from "1.3.2"
    {ok,[]}
