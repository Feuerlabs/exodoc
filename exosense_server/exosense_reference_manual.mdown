**Add user(s) to a role in an account**

This command gives one or more users access to the resources of an account by adding them to a role. Each role will give access to a predefined set of core Exosense Server JSON-RPC commands, as listed in the "Exosense JSON-RPC command Role assignment" chapter of the "Exosense Server Operations Manual". In addition to this, roles can also be given additional execution rights to package RPCs through the [exodm:add-role-execution-permission] command. See the "Package" chapter of the "Exosense Operations Manual" and [exodm:create-package] for details on RPCs and their execution rights. 



Once one or more roles have been assigned to a user, that user can execute all JSON-RPC commands that those roles have execution rights for on the given account. 



The [exodm:list-account-roles] command can be used to retrieve a list of all availale roles for an account that a usert can be assigned to.

**Create a new device in the Exosense Server**

 This commands sets up a new device to be owned and managed by the given account. The mandatory device-id must be unique across all devices and device groups under the owning account. The device type is previously created through a [exodm:create-device-type] command.



The new device can optionally have attributes set for it, where the structure of these attributes is defined by the provided device type. The device type has a yang module, created through an [exodm:create-yang-module] command, tied to it. Inside this module, a container defines the attribute structure that should be applied to all devices assigned to the given device type. 



Unlinke device configuration data (see [exodm:create-package]), device attributes will not be sent to the device. Instead they will be stored locally on the Exosense Server.



The attributes can be set through this command and [exodm:update-device], and retrieved through [exodm:lookup-device].  Protocol plugins can also access the device attributes to locate network addresses and other information necessary for the protocol to communicate with a device.



Once a device has been provisioned through this command, the protocol plugin associated with the assigned device type can match an incoming device ID from the connected device with device attribute data in order to retrieve encryption keys, passwords, network addresses, certificates, etc, that can be used by the plugin to authenticate the device and secure communication with it. Please note that all device attributes, apart from the mandatory device type and device-id, are opaque to the Exosense Server. It is up to the yang-file and protocol plugin author to agree on the structure of the attributes assigned to a device of the given device type.

**Add one or more devices as members of a device group**

This command will add a list of devices as members to a single device group.  Once this command has been completed, JSON-RPCs sent to the device group will be forwarded to all member devices. 



 If a device, who is a member of multiple groups, sends an RPC to the Exosense Server, the RPC will be forwarded to the notification URL (as JSON-RPC) of all groups. The reply to send back to the device is read
from the device group marked as primary for the device. This allows
multiple URLs to receive device data while ensuring that only one
reply is sent back to the device.



 If a device is only member of a single group, the primary flag is ignored.

 If a device itself has a notification URL configured, incoming RPCs from the device will be forwarded to that URL and the notification URL of all device groups
that the device is a member of. In these cases, the reply to send back
to the device will always be read from the notification URL of the
device, thus silently dropping the reply from all device groups that
the device is a member of, including the primary group.



 If a device is member of a device group, and has it marked as primary, when the [exodm:add-device-group-members] command also has the primary flag set, the primary flag will be moved from the previous group to the new one for the device. Thus, only one group will be marked as primary for a device at any given time.

### Elements
**account** The account, accessible by the authorizing user, that owns the device group and devices.  If no account is given, the authorizing user assumes to have access to only one account, which will be used.

**group-name** Name of device group to which to add the given device(s) as members (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: false</em>])

**primary** Flag to indicate that this group should be marked as the primary group for all added devices.
If any of the added devices already have primary groups setup, those groups will be de-selected
in favor of the group specified by this call. (**type:** "1" (true) | "0" (false); [<em>mandatory: false</em>])

**Remove a list of devices as members from a device group**

This command removes the specified devices from the given group. The devices have previously been added to the group through the [exodm:add-device-group-members] command.  If a device removed from a group has that group marked as primary, and the device will still be member
of more than one group, and the device itself does not have a notification URL setup, then any future RPCs received from that device will result in an error being sent back to it by the Exosense Server. This is due to the fact that Exosense does not
know which notification URL to read the reply from.

**Create a new configuration set [deprecated in 2.x]**

This command creates a new configuration set describing an RPC API and configuration data supported by a device. A configuration set is associated with a yang module, created through a [exodm:create-yang-module] command, that describes the configuration data and API interface of the devices that are members of the set. Also tied to the configuration set is a notification URL that will receive all results from RPCs sent to a member device The notification URL will also be used to forward incoming incoming RPCs from the device sent to the server. 



Once a configuration set has been created, it can have devices added to it through the [exodm:add-config-set-members]. All such member devices can have RPCs, as defined in the configuration set yang module, called through the JSON-RPC interface. These devices can also have configuration data updated by the server through the [exodm:update-config-set] and [exodm:push-config-set] commands.



Please note that any RPCs defined in the yang module tied to a configuration set must have a "uses exo:std-request" line in it to include transaction elements used by the Exosense Server to route the RPC to the correct device. See [exo:std-request] for details.

### Elements
**account** The account, accessible by the authorizing user, to which the configuration set belongs.If no account is given, the authorizing user assumes to have access to only one account, which will be used. If no account is given, and the user has access to multiple accounts, an error is returned. (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: false</em>])

**name** Name of the configuration set to create (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: true</em>])

**notification-url** Notification URL to send RPC results and device-originated RPC calls to. (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: false</em>])

**values** Configuration values (validated against the yang spec) to initialize the newly created configuration set with. (**type:** XML; [<em>mandatory: false</em>])

**yang** Name of the yang module to use. Include the ".yang" suffix. (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: true</em>])

**Upload a yang file**

This commands parses the provided yang file and stores it as a yang module in the Exosense Server. The yang file is expected to be compliant with RFC 6020. Once a yang module has been created, it can be used to specify the structure of device attributes, package RPC APIs, and package configuration data. Please see [exodm:create-device-type] for details on device attributes, and [exodm:create-package] for details on package RPC API and configuration data structure. 



 A yang module can be created either in the account or system repository on the Exosense Server. Modules created in the "system\ repository will be accessible to all accounts on the system, while modules created in the "account" repository will only be visible and accessible to the account invoking this command.  Only the exodm-admin account can create a yang module in the system repository. When the system.repository is used, the command has to be sent from the same host that the server is executing on.



If the yang module is uploaded to the "user" repo, then the name of the yang module must be unique among all existing yang modules under the given account, as well as being unique among all existing yang modules in the "system" repository. 

If the yang module is uploaded to the "system" repo, then the name of the yang module must be unique among all existing yang modules created in the Exosense Server. No existing yang module in any "user" repository under any account can have the same name as the new module. Neither can the new module have the same name as an existing yang module in the "system" repository.

### Elements
**account** The account, accessible by the authorizing user, in whose repository the yang modules should be created.If no account is given, the authorizing user assumes to have access to only one account, which will be used. If no account is given, and the user has access to multiple accounts, an error is returned.

 This argument is not used if the yang module to is to be created in the "system" repository. (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: false</em>])

**name** Name of the uploaded yang module, including the .yang prefix. Example is commands.yang.  (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: true</em>])

**repository** Where to store the module in the Exosense Server: Can be "system" or "account" (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: false</em>])

**yang-module** The yang code to create the module from (**type:** string; [<em>mandatory: true</em>])

    }


**Upload a package, with a software image**

This command uploads a package software image and the associated meta data to the Exosense Server.Once the package has been uploaded, it can be added to device types that supports it through the [exodm:add-package-to-device-type] command, and then installed on actual devices through the [exodm:install-package] command.



If the given package is an upgrade, all existing packages that this package can perform an upgrade on can be listed by the upgrade-from-packages argument. Upgrade packages can be installed on a device through the [exodm:upgrade-package] 



If the given package needs other packages installed on a device before itself can be installed, the list of the required packages can be listed in the prerequisite-packages argument. 



When [exodm:install-package] command is called, the server will check its device database to ensure that the prerequisite packages are already installed. If this is not the case, and recursive-dependency-resolve installation has not been selected, an error will be returned. If recursive installation has been selected for the command, all dependency packages will be resolved recursively and transmitted with the package given in package-name to the device.  



If a package has functions that can be remotely invoked on a device from the Exosense Server, the API of those RPCs is specified by the yang module given in the yang-specification argument. Please note that all yang
RPC definitions are global and cannot be hosted in a container. Once the package has been installed on a device, a user with access to an RPC given in the yang module can call the function on the device through the JSON-RPC interface on the Exosense Server. The server will store the call and forward it to the device once it comes online. The result of the executed function will be transported back from the device to the backend server through a notification sent to the device notification URL and the notification URL of any device groups that the device is a member of. 



Please note that any RPCs defined in the yang module tied to a package must have a "uses exo:std-request" line in it to include transaction elements used by the Exosense Server to route the RPC to the correct device. See [exo:std-request] for details.



In order for a package RPC to be executed via a JSON-RPC call, a user must be assigned to a role with execution rights to the RPC. A role is given execution rights to a specific RPC in a package created in an account through the [exodm:add-role-execution-permission] call. Users can then be added to the role through the [exodm:add-user-to-role] the 



If a package has configuration data that can be remotely updated from the Exosense Server, the structure of that data is also specified in the yang module given by the yang-specification argument. The container hosting the configuration data structure is given in the configuration-container argument. 



The configuration data for a package can be set for a package, once it has been installed on a device, through the [exodm:update-package-configuration] command.

### Elements

**Install a package on one or more devices**

Installs the given package on the devices provided in the targets argument. The device IDs can either be listed directly in the argument, or be a member of a listed device group. The package will be transmitted to all resolved target and then installed on them. 



Please note that all devices, either listed directly or through a device group, must be of a device type that accepts the given package. If one or more devices are of a type not accepting the package, a [exodm:package-operation-notification] will be sent back for the failed device with the error code not-supported.



The installation is carried out by invoking the local package manager on the device. This manager will be provided with command line argumens retrieved from the install-arguments string specified to the [exodm:add-package-to-device-type] when the package was added to the device type. 



The package to install may have dependencies on other packages that must be installed on a device before itself can be installed. Such dependencies are listed in the prerequisite-packages argument of the [exodm:create-package] command that created the package.



Prior to processing the install operation on each device, server will check its internal database to ensure that the prerequisite packages are already installed on the device. If this is not the case, and recursive installation has not been selected, an error will be returned. If the recursive-dependency-resolve argument has been set for the install, all dependency packages will be resolved recursively and transmitted with the package given in package-name to the device in order to all be installed at once. on the device. 



For each successful or failed transmit and install operation on a device, a notification will be sent back to the backend server. This allows the backend server to keep track of successes and failures during the install process.  The notification will be sent to the URL registered for the device and any device groups that the device is a member of. Thus, a single device operation may trigger notifications sends to multiple notification URLs. If the same URL is registered multiple times for a device and its groups, the notificaiton will only be sent once to that URL.

The device IDs can either be listed directly in the argument, or be a member of a listed device group. The package in to-package-name will be transmitted to all resolved target and then installed on them. 



In order for the upgrade to processed, the package specified by the from-package-name must be listed in the upgrade-from-packages element of the [exodm:create-package] call that created the package specified by to-package-name.



Please note that all devices, either listed directly or through a device group, must be of a device type that accepts the given package. If one or more devices are of a type not accepting the package, a [exodm:package-operation-notification] will be sent back for the failed device with the error code not-supported.



The upgrade is carried out by invoking the local package manager on the device. This software will be provided with command line argumens retrieved from the upgrade-arguments string specified to the [exodm:add-package-to-device-type] when the package was added to the device type.
